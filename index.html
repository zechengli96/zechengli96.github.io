    <h1>Welcome to Zecheng Li (ˈzɪ

    <p>hi, welcome.</p>

    <p>I have always wished to have a website that would preserve my existence. Imagine that a thousand years from now, we will all have turned into ash, but this website will remain as a digital representation of me. Thanks to Dr. Liu's class, I was able to start this website as a course project, so I didn't require any additional motivation.</p>
    <p>My goal for this website is for it to be unprofessional but still, respectfully. This is for people who want to know more about me and I hope when you browse my site you feel relax and smile all the time, feeling like you see something you did not expect.</p>
